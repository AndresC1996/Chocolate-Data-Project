<h2 id="Chocolate-Data-Project">Chocolate Dataset</h2>
<p>I dеvеlopеd a tableau prеsеntation for chocolate industry investors and stakeholders. I addressed crucial key information for their strategy. Using Python and Tableau, I idеntifiеd and compared the top 10 best rated companies, mapped the worldwide cacao content and company locations, compared sales across regions and analyzed trends .</p>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> This project aims to construct a comprehensive analysis of a dataset including over 1,700 unique chocolate bars, each value evaluated by experts. The dataset encompasses detailed information on the geographical origins of the chocolate, cocoa content, types of chocolate beans, and the specific locations where the beans were cultivated. Ratings scored on a scale ranging from 1 to 5, reflect various categories of flavor excellence, including flavor range, harmony, intensity, texture, aftermelt, and overall impressions. We will also investigate the correlation 
between cocoa content percentage and ratings.  </p>

<p><br> <strong>Key Questions</strong><br/>
<br>●  What is the distribution of chocolate ratings across different cocoa percentages?<br/>
● How does the regional origin of chocolate relate to its flavor ratings?<br/>
● What is the relationship between the percentage of cocoa and the flavor intensity 
of chocolate? <br/>
● How do the ratings of chocolates from different countries compare? <br/>
● What’s the relationship between cocoa solids percentage and rating?<br/></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> In this projеct, I utilizеd Python and Tableau for comprеhеnsivе data analysis. Our goal is to empower businesses and investors in the chocolate industry to make data-driven decisions, and capitalize on emerging market trends, ultimately enhancing their competitive position and driving business growth.</p>
<p><strong>Data set:</strong> This dataset contains expert ratings of over 1,700 individual chocolate bars, along with information on their regional origin, percentage of cocoa, the variety of chocolate bean used and where the beans were grown.</p>
<p><strong>Methods Used</strong> Utilized Numpy, Sklearn, Folium, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and SciPy for visualizations. Created exploratory analysis and descriptive analysis dashboards on Tableau. Utilized a Dickey-Fuller test in python to confirm hypothesis.</p>
